# Fillit
Backtracking algorithm was used.

Fillit is a project that helped to discover and/or familiarize with a recurring problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing. In this particular project, I found a way to assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square.

A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to the popular game Tetris.

Fillit is not about recoding Tetris, even if itâ€™s still a variant of this game. Program took a file as parameter, which contains a list of Tetriminos, and arrange them in order to create the smallest square possible.

Obviously, main goal is to find the smallest square in the minimal amount of time, despite an exponentially growing number of possibilities each time a piece is added.
